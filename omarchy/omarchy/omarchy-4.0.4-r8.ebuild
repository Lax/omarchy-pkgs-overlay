DESCRIPTION="Omarchy desktop core: CLI, themes and shell (meta package)"
HOMEPAGE="https://github.com/omacom/omarchy"

# Mirrors the pin block of upstream omacom/omarchy-pkgs pkgbuilds/omarchy.
# _tag is provenance only; _commit is the single source of truth. Must stay in
# lockstep with omarchy/omarchy-settings — scripts/bump-omarchy.sh rewrites both.
OMARCHY_TAG="v4.0.4"
OMARCHY_COMMIT="c668141e9c42b13c80c9ca4ea108e11708c5e8a5"
SRC_URI="https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/archive/${OMARCHY_COMMIT}.tar.gz -> omarchy-${PV}.tar.gz"

# Translation of the upstream PKGBUILD depends array: "only packages whose
# removal would brick the desktop" plus what the omarchy-* scripts require.
#   omarchy-keyring     -> n/a (portage verifies Manifest hashes)
#   omarchy-settings    -> lockstep pin, mirrors upstream's =omarchy-settings
#   fakeroot/pacman-contrib -> the portage toolbelt (eix/gentoolkit/portage-utils)
#   limine*/snapper     -> Gentoo boots via grub/systemd-boot; no bootloader here
#   ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd-basic -> media-fonts/jetbrains-mono-nerd-basic
# tensaku -> upstream base.packages line 114 and the default screenshot
#   editor: omarchy-capture-screenshot hands captures to tensaku-edit
#   unless $OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_EDITOR is set
